Midjourney Assistant Tool

Welcome to MAT!

I find myself using Midjourney a lot. I decided to create a small tool that would help me with recurring selections. So, I made this tool where I can input various artists by name, select a few parameters, and then press the copy button to easily place what I want in the clipboard for pasting into Discord or an image prompt.

The artist names were taken from https://midlibrary.io/, and no, not ALL the names are included in this tool. Feel free to replace the names included in this tool with your own selections.

    - The "No people" option attempts to remove any people from your art.
    - The "T-shirt vector" option aims to make art more suitable for shirts and also tries to apply a black background.
    - There are radio buttons for Niji or Midjourney.
    - There are radio buttons for 250/500/750 stylize options.

The tool includes a Save and Load function, allowing you to save your favorite selections!
