Midjourney Assistant Tool v1.1

Welcome to MAT 1.1 UPDATE!

I find myself using Midjourney a lot. I decided to create a small tool that would help me with staging recurring selections. So, I made this tool where I can input various artists by name, select a few parameters, and then press the copy button to easily place what I want in the clipboard for pasting into Discord or an image prompt.

Features include:

    - The save feature has been completely revamed, stores input and GUI selections into a json file (NEW)
    - No more shit load of listboxes!  Now start with a drop down menu, then select specific style (NEW)
    - Can't find a specific style you know is there?  Search function now help you! (NEW)
    - New radio buttons to test out 0/50/75/100 chaos options (NEW)
    - My personal favorite, the random fucntionality completley reworked to select a style for you! (NEW)
    - The "No people" option attempts to remove any people from your art.
    - The "T-shirt vector" option aims to make art more suitable for shirts and also tries to apply a black background.
    - The "Logo vector" option aims to make art more suitable for creating logos also tries to apply a black background.
    - There are radio buttons for Niji or Midjourney.
    - There are radio buttons for 0/250/500/750/1000 stylize options.
