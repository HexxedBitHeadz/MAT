Midjourney Assitant Tool

Welcome to MAT! 

I find myself using Midjourney, like a lot.  I decided to make a small tool that would help me with reoccuring selections.  So I made this tool, where I put in various arists by name, and I can select a few parameters, and hit the copy button that easily puts what I want in the clipboard for me to paste into Discord /imagine prompt.

The artist name were taken from https://midlibrary.io/, and no, not ALL the names are inlcuded in this tool.  Free free to replace the names incldued in this tool with your own selection.


Includes a Save and Load function, allowing you to save your favorite selections!
