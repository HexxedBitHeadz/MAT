Midjourney Assistant Tool v1.1

Welcome to MAT 1.1 UPDATE!

I find myself using Midjourney a lot. I decided to create a small tool that would help me with staging recurring selections. So, I made this tool where I can simply insert my prompt, quickly select some frequent options and copy to paste into midjourney.<br>

Features include:<br>
    - The save feature has been completely revamed, stores input and GUI selections into a json file (NEW)<br>
    - No more shit load of listboxes!  Now start with a drop down menu, then select specific style (NEW)<br>
    - Can't find a specific style you know is there?  Search function now help you! (NEW)<br>
    - New radio buttons to test out 0/50/75/100 chaos options (NEW)<br>
    - My personal favorite, the random fucntionality completley reworked to select a style for you! (NEW)<br>
    - The "No people" option attempts to remove any people from your art.<br>
    - The "T-shirt vector" option aims to make art more suitable for shirts and also tries to apply a black background.<br>
    - The "Logo vector" option aims to make art more suitable for creating logos also tries to apply a black background.<br>
    - There are radio buttons for Niji or Midjourney.<br>
    - There are radio buttons for 0/250/500/750/1000 stylize options.
